title: Vulnerability in Pizza Hut NZ website - Free pizza for everyone! 
category: Vulns and Exploits
---

So on the 25th of November this year, I did a talk on a vulnerability I found on the Pizza Hut NZ that lets you get anything from the website delivered for free with some pretty minimal 'hacking' required. Pretty epic. 


I've made my best attempts to reach out to Restaurant brands through their customer support, employees on LinkedIn and through CERT NZ with no luck. 

**I am not confirming or denying that this actually works or that I have attempted to exploit this vulnerability in anyway.**

Some background:

Due to the COVID epidemic, Pizza Hut have removed cash payment for deliveries on their website and have trained their staff to drop and knock at the door. 

One thing they forgot to do was remove the cash option on the backend of the server.
